# Newso
A website that performs both text summarization of a news article and detects if the news article is reliable or not. The user would simply have to provide a url string, and with the help of python libraries such as nltk and scikit-learn, the website functions as intended. For text summarization, it was possible to perform text-extration and select keywords based on their frequency, this would allow for text to thus be summarized in a few sentences. As for determining if a news article is reliable or not, scikit-learn came with prepackaged machine learning algorithms such tfidfvectorizer which would allow for the training of a dataset. After having trained the model, we can deploy and make use of it to determine if other articles are reliable or not.
